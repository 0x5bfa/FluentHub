# Contribution

## Issues
  - Use proper issue template(select bug report, feature request, or raw template)
  - Please follow the template and provide a clear overview of the problem.

## Pull Requests
  - When making code changes, follow the code style of other codes as much as possible.
  - Do not make substantial changes to the documentation. If you do, please let us know in an Issue.
  - Make sure all checks are completed successfully when the changes are completed
  - Make CodeFactor happy. Be sure to correct errors.

## Internationalization and localization
  - GitHub does not provide localization. Therefore, this feature is probably one of the most important.
  - While in the Dev version, do not create resources and open PR, as it is often expected that UI changes will be made.
  - See [this documentation](translations.md)

## Build
  - See [this documentation](build-from-source.md)
  - If you are unable to successfully build, please let us know via [our Discord server](https://discord.com/channels/935562861701390336).
