#### These are the translation/i18n resources for FluentHub

---

Before contributing to these string resources, *please please please* read this!

Currently, Crowdin translation is implemented to manage the translation resources for FluentHub. Therefore, you are strongly encouraged, if not required, to translate exclusively on that platform.
No matter how great, your translation PRs will be declined or rejected if you do not adhere to this.
You can contribute easily at [crowdin.com/fluenthub](https://crowdin.com/project/fluenthub), which will ensure your translations are implemented.
If a language is missing and you'd like to contribute a new one, feel free to ask in a new issue or via [the FluentHub Discord server](https://dsc.gg/fluenthub).
