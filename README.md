## Builds

If you are building a project, you need to look at [this documentation](building-from-source.md).

## Our goals

* Multi-tab support
  * Go back and forward on the page(now disabled)
  * Jump to the page with the URL of GitHub
  * Share button (URL copy) for current page
* App settings
  * AppTheme
  * Default new page
* Octokit.NET authorization
  * Make up for missing API requests with HttpRequest class and GraphQL.NET.
* Support for rendered markdown displaying using WebView

## Translation

FluentHub is different from traditional GitHub in that it needs to be made available in a variety of languages.
But we are currently in the Dev stage, so the scope of translation is limited.

See [this documentation](translations.md)
