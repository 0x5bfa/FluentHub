This is the preferred installation method. It allows you to always be on the latest version when we release new builds via automatic updates.

### GitHub

<a title="GitHub" href='https://github.com/0x5BFA/FluentHub/releases/latest'>

</a>

Released builds can be manually downloaded from this [repository's releases page](https://github.com/FluentHub/FluentHub/releases).

Download the `FluentHub_<versionNumber>.msixbundle` file from the `Assets` section. In order to install the app, you can simply double-click on the .msixbundle file, and the app installer should automatically run. If that fails for any reason, you can try the following command with a PowerShell prompt:

```powershell
# NOTE: If you are using PowerShell 7+, please run
#   Import-Module Appx -UseWindowsPowerShell
# before using Add-AppxPackage.

Add-AppxPackage FluentHub_<versionNumber>.msixbundle
```
